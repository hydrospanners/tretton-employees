## Architecture and design choices
Container, component - architecture. Keeps it simple to test components and allows for *single responsibility princible*.

## Motivation to packages and frameworks
* NextJS - Framework that I know well and can set up quickly, but still have a good set of tools to expand the product if needed
* TypeScript - I feel typescript helps a lot if more than one developer is in the codebase. Doesn't remove the neeed for comments, but code becomes easier to understand and read.
* Zustand - I don't really need a state management, but it's what I'm used to working with and it is as easy to set up as any any react-useState counterpart but scales well if the product will need it later.
* Material UI - Easy to use and responsive ui framework

list stories 5-7: ( - story & why? )
- Responsive design, works on mobile and tablets - I feel it's important that every product is responsive and works on all device-types. 
- Use TypeScript - Freebie since I prefere to use it for any product of size or if a team is involved.
